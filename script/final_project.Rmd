## Join Data
Datasets were **joined** (demographics dataset and physical activity dataset)
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
library(here)
library(janitor)
demographics <- import(here("data", "Teen-Demographic-SPSS(1) copy.zip"))

phys_act <- import(here("data", "Teen-PA-SPSS(1) copy.zip"))

# joined demographics and PA-questionnaire by participant ID "PID"
joined_set <- demographics %>% full_join(phys_act, by = "PID")


# selecting only variables that we may use
selected_variables <- joined_set %>% 
  select(TAGE, TGRADE, TSEX, TSCHLTYPE, XTHEIGHTCM_RC, XTWEIGHTKG_RC, TETHRAC_RC, TPMPABAD, TPMPAWANT, TPMPAUPST, TPMPAIMPT, XTPREDWEEKS, XTPREDWEEKOFS, XTPREDWEEKW)
```

## Filter and Mutate
We **filtered** to only show _high school respondents_ & then used **mutate()**
to create a column for BMI (calculated from height/weight
```{r}
highschool_only <- selected_variables %>% 
  filter(TAGE >= 14 | TAGE < 18) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(TAGE))

HS_W_BMI <- highschool_only %>% 
  mutate(Height_M = XTHEIGHTCM_RC / 100) %>% 
  mutate(BMI = XTWEIGHTKG_RC/(Height_M^2))
```
