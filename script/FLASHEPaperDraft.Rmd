# Abstract

# Introduction

(define significance of our topic) Adolescent physical activity is important to ***
This project used data from the Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health and Eating (FLASHE) study to examine patterns of adolescent physical activity, including when they exercise, how much they exercise, and to explore the association between adolescent BMI, sex, and school type with their exercise patterns. The FLASHE study was conducted by the National Cancer Institute in 2014. Through a cross-sectional, internet-based design, it collected responses from parents and teens to look at psychosocial, generational, and environmental correlates of cancer-related behaviors (CITE from https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/hbrb/flashe-study)  
* i want to try Havi's 'share' for how to include a website image in the paper and bring in the FLASHE Conceptual model here. 

## Research Questions (to be changed based on figures. included as placeholders)

**1. How do patterns of physical activity for adolescents (when they exercise) vary by their BMI and demographics(school type, sex and age)?**

**2. How does the total amount of exercise relate to BMI and demographics?**

# Method

## Joining Data Sets

## Cleaning data (characterize... 

## Calculating BMI - group_by
## Calculating Mean Physical Activity - summarize
## Pivot_Longer for organzing when physical activity occurs

# Results

## Summary Table

## Figure 1
## Figure 2
## Figure 3

# Discussion

Based on our analysis of adolescents who participated in the FLASE study...
Implications for programs to promote physical activity in or out of school..
Implications for policy..
Next steps for research include examining what motivates adolescents to complete physical activity, and how their environment moderates or mediates the amount of physical activity they complete.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
